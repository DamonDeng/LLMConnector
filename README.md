# LLMConnector

LLMConnector is a module of azerothcore 
to connect AWS Bedrock Claude LLM model to support AI NPC.

To use this module, please setup the azerothcore-wotlk server following instructions of azerothcore.

The instructions can be found from the original github repo of azerothcore:

"https://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk"

Or you can find a forked branch following the link below:

"https://github.com/DamonDeng/azerothcore-wotlk"

Then clone this project into the `modules` folder, rerun cmake of azerothcore, and rebuild the azerothcore server.

After the LLMConnector module is loaded, you can login to the game, select NPC, then talk to him/her.

At present, the PE setting is only designed for Deputy Willem in Northshire Valley, and only Chinese PE.

More dev work will be introduced to integrate more NPC, in more language.
